# ``Lindenmayer``

Lindenmayer provides a library you can use and extend to develop your own [Lindenmayer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system), in the Swift programming language.

## Overview

While the package includes a number example L-systems, the primary intent is to allow you to create L-systems with rules and modules that you define.
This implementation provides support for context sensitive, and parametric grammars when creating your L-system.

The library provides 2D and 3D representation rendering of a current L-system states, including some SwiftUI views that you can use to display either 2D or 3D results:
- The 2D representation uses [Canvas](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/Canvas) and [GraphicsContext](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/graphicscontext) from [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) on Apple platforms.
- The 3D representation uses [SceneKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit) on Apple platforms.
