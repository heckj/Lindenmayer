# ``Lindenmayer``

Lindenmayer provides a library to develop and run your own Lindenmayer Systems.

## Overview

The package includes the core types to support you in building your own Lindenmayer systems (also known as L-systems), and a number examples sourced from Wikipedia and research papers.
The library provides types and APIs enable you to create L-systems with rules and modules that you define, and renderers to generate 2D and 3D representations of the results.

The 2D renderer uses [Canvas](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/Canvas) and [GraphicsContext](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/graphicscontext) from [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) on Apple platforms.
The 3D renderer uses [SceneKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit) on Apple platforms.
The related package ``LindenmayerViews`` provides SwiftUI views that present the results of the renderers.

The API provides support for both context free and context sensitive L-system grammars, as well as parametric grammars.

To get support for using this package, see the [Discussions on Github](https://github.com/heckj/Lindenmayer/discussions) for questions and community feedback, or the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/heckj/Lindenmayer/issues).
