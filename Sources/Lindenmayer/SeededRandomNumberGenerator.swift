/// The protocol includes an adjustable position property that represents the current location within the space of random numbers that the random number generates.
/// The seed value is preserved and unchanged, allowing the seeded random number generator to be interrogated and replicated.
/// When applied to a pseudo-random number generator, with a given seed and position, the next random number should be  completely deterministic.
